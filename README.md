*Technologies I used in this project were:
- Flexbox;
- Responsive Design;
- Grid;

*Challanges I faced:
- Understanding how to mix Flexbox with Grid was a huge problem in the beggining but this project helped me understand how to actually use them even better,
- Creating space between different divs also making sure that while editing one media quary I dont by mistake make error in the other one,
- If possible I will try not to use as many absolute position if I can - seems to create more problems then actually helps,
